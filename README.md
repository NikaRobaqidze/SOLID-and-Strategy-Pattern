## Description
A game developer in the MMORPG category wants to rewrite his game from assembly instructions to OOP language.
The main player in the game should be the Player class, which has:

Heath points (HP),

Weapon (sword, katana, etc.) -> attackPower()

Defense (bronze, iron, etc.) -> defensePower()

The manufacturer wants the player to be able to change weapons and armor dynamically during the game.
The weapon must have an attack rating (DP). And armor is a defense indicator.
